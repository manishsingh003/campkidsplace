                <h3>Summer Vacation</h3> is what every kid looks forward to throughout the school years.  Camp Kids Place wants
                to make sure that every camper’s summer is even better than they could have dreamed.  With eight, thematic,
                weeks packed with variety, adventure, and fun every single day, Camp Kids Place 2019 will give you lasting
                memories for years to come. We make sure your summer is full of highlights with safety as our top priority!
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> Here’s a little of what we’ve planned for this summer… </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Camp Kids Place takes place conveniently within the facilities of Cherrydale Baptist Church in Arlington, Virginia.
                With a wonderful gym, team rooms, our craft shop, a giant waterslide, and many thematic surprises along the way,
                we pack out our facilities for an awesome time all summer long.  When it comes to activities in a Camp Kids Place
                summer, the obvious question is, “What more could a kid ask for?”
            </p>
            <p>
                At camp we ensure that hire the best Staff and Counselors around.  Every year, it is our staff that makes lasting
                memories with kids of Camp Kids Place.  Our staff is highly trained, carefully vetted, and make camp the joyful place
                that it is year after year.  Camp is like a big family encouraging and strengthening one another.  We will do whatever
                it takes to make sure your child feels at home at Camp Kids Place and walk away with new friends and new experiences!
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Our campers enjoy learning a lot as they have a great time. They go home feeling that they’ve spent the day with good
                friends who really care about them as individuals—as well as an important part of the group. It’s just the thing for
                kids enjoying their first camp experience as well as for “seasoned pros” who’ve been to camp before.
            </p>
            <p> 
                We’re planning everything carefully to make each week great. All weeks will fill up before camp begins. So plan on
                selecting your weeks soon so your family will not be disappointed by a full camp. You and your camper will love what
                we’ve planned. We’ll make sure your child has a safe and fun time each day at camp!
